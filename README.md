# Speed Study

This project has been created during the first week of the AREA project at Epitech. The AREA project is part of the third year project's at Epitech. It is made in group of 5 and corresponds to the creation of Actions - Reactions similarly to [IFTTT website](https://ifttt.com/)

The goal of this small project however is to showcase different backend technologies that we could use for our project and thus see which one is the fastest at responding our requests.

In order to test urself, please refer to the documentations given in each techno folder and in the test folder.

Have a nice day!
